# Wild Plants Edibility Prediction Using IBM Watson - SmartInternz Externship

Some wild plants are edible , but identifying them can be time consuming. So with the use of Convolution Neural Networks(CNN), we trained our image classifier on a variety of mountainous and wild edible plant images. The user inputs an image into our webpage  supported with Flask ,which serves as the frontend of the model. The model classifies it and predicts the class of wild plant and states if it is edible or not.
We have trained this model on a wide dataset of images. It's accuracy is generally quite high.
